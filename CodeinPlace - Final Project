"""
Programming interest stems from the integration of Computer Science and Biology. Created a simple program that enables the read of FASTA files which strips the 
first line of "code". The first line of code describes the DNA sequence in question and provides a header with a reference number to the gene. 

Started off simple by creating a program that reads FASTA files DNA-seq and transcribes it into RNA-seq. This program strips the first line and replaces T's with
U's, indicating DNA transcription to RNA. 

In the future, further develop of this code would be adding code to translate RNA into protein. This would mean codons would be generated which corresponds to a 
specific amino acid.
